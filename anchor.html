        <h3>Lets learn working of anchor tag and href(Hyper - Reference)</b3>
        Anchor Tag is a tag used to link your page with another page.<br>
        It is a container Tag so closing of the tag is required.<br>
        To go to another page within the anchor tag linking is required by the help of hyperreference which is denoted by 'href'.<br>
        Within href we have to put the nameof our file or page we want to get in.<br>
        <h4>SO LETS GO TO THE PAGE OF TABLE WITH ADDRESS table.html and we have made our link NEXT within the anchor tag.</h4>
        <a href="table.html">NEXT</a>
    </body>
