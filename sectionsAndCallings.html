            <h1>PRIMARY MEMORY  : -</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>It is also known as main memory of computer system.<br>
                     Primary memory is used to store data and instructions of a program during computer operations. </li>
                <li>It uses semiconductor technolgy and hence is called as semiconductor memory.</li><br>
                <li>Primary memory is of two types :-</li><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="#us1">RAM,SRAM,DRAM</a></li><br>

                            <li>It is a volatile memory.(VOlatile memory means IT stores information with power if power supply stops or interupt all data will be lost.)</li>
                            <li>Ram is used to boosting up or to star the computer.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>CAChe memory is example of internal memory.</li>
                <li>CACHE memory is very high speed and special type of memory.</li>
                <li>It is used to speed up and sycnhronize with high speed cpu.</li>
                <li>It act as buffer b/w RAM and CPU.</li>
                <li>It holds frequently requested data, so that immediately available for CPU when asked.</li>
                <li>Cache memory is used to reduce average time to access data.</li>
                <li>There are various different independent cache in CPU. </li>
                <li>The performance of CACHE is measured in HIT RATIO.</li>
                <li>If the processor needs to read or write a location it goes to cache.<br>
                 If Cache finds the location for processor then CACHE HIT occurs,<br>
                ELSE cache miss </li>
                <li>THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF CACHE:-</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRIMARY CACHE:- It is located on Processor chip.It has the speed like of registers</li>
                    <li>SECONDARY CACHE:- It is located somewhere b/w primary cache and rest all memory.It is reffered as level2(L2) cache.</li>
